Game is called Trump soccer and was inspired by soccer game on messenger.
The objective is to click on the trumps head and don't let it fall down trying to outbest your score.
I made it while attending the Introduction to computer science FIT CVUT course in summer 2019.
It was made with their libraries and I am not able to get my hands on them anymore so it's just the java code.
